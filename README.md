## Risk Management

Tools and patterns for managing trading risk in autonomous agents.

- **Position sizing**: Max % of account per trade (recommend 5-20%)
- **Leverage limits**: Hard cap per strategy (recommend 3-5x)
- **Mandatory stop-loss**: Every trade must have SL before entry
- **Circuit breakers**: Auto-halt trading on drawdown thresholds
- **Cooldown periods**: Enforced rest after losing trades
- **Asset whitelists**: Only trade pre-approved assets
- **Concurrent position limits**: Prevent overexposure
- **Decision audit trails**: Store agent reasoning, orders, and outcomes for review and memory (e.g. [TradeMemory Protocol](https://github.com/mnemox-ai/tradememory-protocol))
