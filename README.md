# Awesome Agent Trading [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated directory of AI trading agents, broker integrations, MCP servers, skills, and research tools for US equities and options, global crypto and DeFi, and prediction markets.

Explore tools for market research, strategy development, and order execution. Account and venue availability depend on the integration and jurisdiction.

Use the categories below to distinguish research, backtesting, paper trading, and live execution. Listings describe upstream capabilities, not verified trading performance. Official hosted services, open-source software, and source-available projects are labeled separately where reviewed.

## Data, Wallets & Risk Infrastructure

### Wallet and action toolkits

[Coinbase AgentKit](https://github.com/coinbase/agentkit) provides wallets and on-chain actions for agents (Apache-2.0). It supplies execution tools rather than a trading strategy.

### General agent runtimes

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and [ElizaOS](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) can host agent workflows; trading capabilities depend on installed integrations.

### Data & Market Intelligence

Data sources and APIs for market analysis by agents.

### Risk controls to evaluate

- **Execution permissions**: Separate read-only research from order submission and fund transfers.
- **Configurable budgets**: Enforce position, leverage, concentration, and loss limits in execution code.
- **Order lifecycle**: Use idempotency, fresh-price checks, fill reconciliation, and explicit cancellation handling.
- **Approval and shutdown**: Support human review, paper/dry-run modes, and a tested kill switch.
- **Exit handling**: Document supported stop orders, rejected orders, partial fills, and disconnected sessions.
- **Audit trails**: Record proposals, approvals, orders, and outcomes; [TradeMemory Protocol](https://github.com/mnemox-ai/tradememory-protocol) is one tool to investigate.

Prompt instructions alone are not execution-layer enforcement. A project's documented controls are not an independent security or performance audit.

## Machine-Readable Data

[data/projects.json](data/projects.json) is a **featured subset**, not a complete export of every README entry. It retains the existing fields and adds review metadata to newly reviewed entries: `modes`, `origin`, `license`, `license_source`, `notes`, `last_verified`, `verification`, and `sources`. Missing fields on older entries mean **not reviewed**, not unsupported. A license declaration can come from a README or package manifest; consult `license_source` and `notes` for its basis.

`modes` distinguishes `research`, `backtest`, `paper`, `dry-run`, and `live`; dry-run does not imply simulated fills. `verification: upstream-documentation` means a documentation review, not a runtime test. Hosted services use a null code license. [llms.txt](llms.txt) provides a compact directory summary.

## FAQ

### What is agent trading?

Agent trading uses AI agents to research markets, call financial tools, propose decisions, or execute orders under configured controls. Research-only tools and live trading systems have different capabilities.

### Where should I start for US equities and options?

Start with [Alpaca MCP Server](https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-mcp-server) for official paper/live tools, or [Robinhood Agentic Trading](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/agentic-trading-overview/) for an eligible dedicated account. [Lumibot](https://github.com/Lumiwealth/lumibot) provides a Python backtesting and execution runtime. Check account eligibility and data entitlements.

### Are these skills limited to OpenClaw?

No. This directory includes MCP servers, CLIs, SDKs, and agent skills. Each upstream project documents compatible clients and setup requirements.

### Can AI agents trade on Polymarket or Kalshi?

The venues expose APIs, and this list includes Polymarket CLI, Simmer SDK, Kalshi Trading Bot CLI, and community MCP integrations. Check venue eligibility, credentials, and whether a tool uses simulated or real orders.

### Does inclusion mean a strategy is profitable or audited?

No. Entries describe tools and documented capabilities. Backtests, author-reported live results, and independent evaluations are different kinds of evidence.
